# My Vim Configuration
The main configuration file is `.vimrc`. It references four other files:
1. `editor.vim`: Editor configurations
2. `keymap.vim`: My custom keybindings
3. `plugin.vim`: Plugins
4. `theme.vim`: Theme settings
Place these files in `~/.vim/`, and .vimrc must be in `~/` (the home directory).

I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as the Plugin Manager.
